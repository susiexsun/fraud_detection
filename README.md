# fraud_detection
End-to-end model and dashboard

## Context

We built a fraud detection model for a hypothetical ecommerce company. The goal was to flag fraudulent accounts based on user attributes and activity. 

The deliverables were: 
- Create model that minimizes false negatives
- Create flask app with documented API
- Build interactive front-end dashboard

This project was built over 48 hours as a collaboration between myself and Kevin Lee (kmlee17).
