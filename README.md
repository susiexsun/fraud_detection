# Context

The goal was to build a fraud detection model for a hypothetical ecommerce company.

### The Data: 
- Static user attributes (Org Name, Org Description, etc)
- User activity

### The Deliverables: 
- Model that minimizes false negatives
- Flask app and interactive front-end dashboard

This project was built over 48 hours as a collaboration between myself and Kevin Lee (kmlee17).
